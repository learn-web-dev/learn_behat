# Activity stream
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-689
  As an Alice team member,
  I can see at a glance what questions / research / resources / responses / discussions, etc. are changing So that I understand the bigger picture of work taking place. I can filter to see items I am subscribed to (either I've interacted with the entity or someone has subscribed me to it) So that I get the updates that most affect me.. other possible needs to listen for in client feedback and then evaluate keyword search, filter by type, filter/order by priority, select a date range (not mvp), user who made most recent change. examples of items in the activity stream discussion of direction research should go, or let's be sure we cover xyz in the answer) Katie might say "sent back to researcher" and give comments about what is needed.
  MVP Use Content Activity Stream with the following filters: <ul><li>Filter: none</li><li>Sort: none</li><li>Grouping: none</li><li>Operations: none</li><ul>
