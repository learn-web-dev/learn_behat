# Site visitor rates a question
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-191 |||||| Feature: As a site visitor
  I can rate a question to let other site visitors know how the value I assign to the question
  Scenario:
  As a site visitor
  I select the number of starts to assign to a question to give my rating of the question
  Accessibility considerations
  I need to be sure that I am choosing the correct rating. If radio buttons are used, they should be clearly labeled and should be given a legend and field set. If a drop-down is used, each item within the drop-down should be easy to understand. If non-custom controls are used, it is important that I can determine name, role, value, i.e. what is the name of the control, is it a link/button/how do I interact with it and is it currently selected.
