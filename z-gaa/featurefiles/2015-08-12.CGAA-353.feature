# track who works on content
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-353
  stub auditor persona: eteam member needing to take on the next step or an external 'investigator' needing to understand the origins of a piece of content as an auditor of content
  I can keep track of who worked on content, even users who are inactive
  I can see what decisions were made and what possibilities were considered
  I can understand the cultural significance as well as factual aspects of the work I can look at a question that was written a few years ago, and still know who did the research, writing, and editing, even if those people are no longer on staff
