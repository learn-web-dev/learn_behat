# WYSIWYG
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-465
  As an anonymous site visitor
  I do not have WYSIWYG options for any text area so that text I enter is always formatted by the theme layer
  As an editorial team member,
  I have sensible minimal defaults so that the toolbars are reasonably uncluttered while also providing the tools needed most often.
  As an editorial team member,
  I can choose styles from a dropdown menu (e.g. Header 1) and the related markup will successfully be rendered.
