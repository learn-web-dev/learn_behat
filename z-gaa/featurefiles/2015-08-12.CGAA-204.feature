# Researcher uploads supplemental document
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-204
  As a researcher, I may need to upload a supplmental document to the CMS for two reasons: either the source I'm referring to in my research document cannot be copied and pasted (like some .pdf files) OR I am uploaded an additional research document with three or fewer sources for updates to an existing, already published question.
