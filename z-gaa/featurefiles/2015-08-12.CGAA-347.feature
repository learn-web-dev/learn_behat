# Question identified as needing update
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-347 |||||| Feature: As a member of the editorial team
  I can notify the manager that an existing node needs work So that all team members have a way of flagging issues
  Scenario:
  A researcher searching for related Q&As finds a Q&A that requires an update so they assign it the needs review status
  Original story from Amanda: Researcher is preparing a researcher document to be submitted. Part of this process requires the researcher to identify related questions that are live on the site. These related questions will be used in the researcher document to provide context for the writer and may, ultimately, be used in the published answer to provide suggested reading for GAA! users. As the researcher looks for related questions on the live site, s/he finds a Q&A that is in need of major updates. Currently, the researcher will email the manager notifying her that the Q&A needs work.
  Problem: A bit inefficient. Researcher needs to use a different system to notify manager of the Q&A that needs updated. Manager also has to use a different system to reference which question has been flagged.
  Frequency of “story”: Weekly
  Solution? Is there a way to manage within the CMS? Flagging?
