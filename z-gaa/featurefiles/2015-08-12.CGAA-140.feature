# Preserve audit trail of content
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-140 |||||| Feature: Preserve audit trail of content.
  scenario: Major change to a published question As a member of the editorial team tasked with considering MAJOR changes to a PUBLISHED question THAT WILL REMAIN PUBLISHED while work is in progress,
  I can create a new copy so updates to the question can be made and the existing (unchanged) public version can remain available.. When updates are complete, I have a simple process for replacing the old question with the new one and preserving the entire history (old question and new in a continuously auditable trail).
