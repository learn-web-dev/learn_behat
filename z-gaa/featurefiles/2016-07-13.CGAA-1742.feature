# Review of Progress messages on a question
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-1742
  Feature: an editorial team member reviewing prior progress on a question should be able to easily view all of the progress messages added previously so that they are informed before they start on their task assignment for the question
  Scenario: display messages in a way that they can be hidden when a question is being worked on As an editorial team member working on a question
  I can view all progress messages that have previously been added to the question in a way that can be hidden as needed so that my view of the question is as efficient as possible for the task assignment I am performing. Scenario:
  many progress messages added As an editorial team member working on a question
  I can view all progress messages that have previously been added regardless of the number of progress messages so that I have a complete picture of all prior progress messages before I begin my work on the question. Scenario: long progress messages added As an editorial team member working on a question
  I can view the complete text of all progress messages that have previously been added regardless of the length of the progress messages so that I have a complete picture of all prior progress messages before I begin my work on the question
