# Site visitor views related questions
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-376 |||||| Feature: As a site visitor viewing a Q&A
  I am presented with a list of related question links to allow me to access other questions on the same subject
  Accessibility considerations These links should be presented as an unordered list, so that my assistive technology conveys the list relationship. In addition, links should clearly indicate where they will take me. Terms like "click here" "view more" are strongly discouraged because they do not clearly indicate what will happen if activated.
  Feature: As a site visitor viewing a Q&A In order more easily to find related questions
  I can get a fly-out menu of links to them at the top of the page (see "meditation")
