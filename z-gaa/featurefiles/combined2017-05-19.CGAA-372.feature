# Site visitor views poll results
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-372
  Feature:
  As a anonymous site visitor
  I view the results of a poll to determine how others feel about the subject
  Scenario:
  As an anonymous site visitor
  I select the view results option to view the aggregated results of the poll
  Scenario:
  As an anonymous site visitor
  I view the percentage of users that chose each option on the poll to determine how others feel about the subject
  Accessibility considerations
  I need to be able to understand which percentage goes with which poll option. This data might be presented to me marked up as an HTML table with clearly defined row and column scope. If this information is presented graphically, a non-graphical representation must also be present such that I have access to the same data as those looking at the graph.
