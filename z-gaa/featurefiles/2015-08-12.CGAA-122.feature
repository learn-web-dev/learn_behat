# GAA maintains control over GAA content
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-122
  As GAA I maintain complete control over GAA content. Licensees can add, create, update and delete domain content (content related specifically to the licensee's organization, e.g. contact information for its own health services). Go Ask Alice has complete control over GAA content, e.g. reader questions, reader responses, polls, etc.
