# Site visitor views related resources
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-375
  Feature: As a site visitor viewing a Q&A
  I am presented with a list of related resource links to allow me to access additional information on the subject
  Accessibility considerations
  If these additional resources constitute a list, they should be grouped in an HTML unordered list so that I can follow the structure using my assistive technology. In addition, it might be helpful for me if a heading marks the beginning of this content as that would allow me to quickly jump to this section.
