# Reader responses are reviewed and published
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-318
  As a graduate student with the ability to work on reader responses
  I can read the reader response and decide if it is worth publishing and I can publish it or I can send it to a manager for review so that the reader response can be handled without additional workflow. I can indicate a state so that I can filter responses and work efficiently (example: the queue of new submissions isn't cluttered with things I've made a decision on). Proposed decision states: no decision made pass in progress published. Proposed requirements flags: need manager attention / manager input available (make consistent with flags on Question)
