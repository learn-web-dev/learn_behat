# Notify users of new workflow assignments via email not Dashboard
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-200
  As a Writer, I work off-site and am not in the CMS daily to check my queue. I am unaware when a new assignment has been added to my queue. One writer suggested that an email notification be sent when a new assignment has been added to their queue.
  Note: This might also be of interest to the researchers as well â€” though it would be great to have the option, but not have to have it automated.
