# Site visitor views other reader responses
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-325 |||||| Feature: As a anonymous site visitor
  I have access to view published reader responses in reverse chronological order so I can see responses to the question I am viewing
  Accessibility considerations
  I want to be sure a mechanism exists to enable me to quickly skip from one comment to another. Perhaps each comment could be an item in an unordered list? The name of each commenter could also be marked up as a heading, however, this may have SEO implications.
