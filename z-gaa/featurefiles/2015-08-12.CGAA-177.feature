  I use the navigational controls to navigate through the quiz
  Accessibility considerations Using my assistive technology, I must be able to interact with each control. As such, each control should be properly labeled and should be given field sets and legends. In this way, there will be no confusion about which question I am answering.
  Navigation controls should also be accessible to me. I should be able to determine where I am in the flow and what will come next. There are a few ways to accomplish this mainly using off screen text in navigation anchors. For example, the word "current" could be added to the end of the anchor denoting my current step in the flow. Although not required, "completed" could be appended off screen to those steps that I have already completed.
