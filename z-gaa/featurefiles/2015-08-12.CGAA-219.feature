# Reader views snippets of answer using search
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-219
  Feature: As an anonymous user
  I can search the site to locate information I am interested in
  Scenario:
  As an anonymous user
  I enter alcohol poisoning as a search term and snippets of Q&As that have alcohol poisoning in the question or answer are displayed
  Scenario:
  As an anonymous user
  I enter alcohol poisoning as a search term and a reader response that includes the search term of alcohol poisoning is not displayed. Original story from Katie: As a reader, I am able to see snippets of the answer of a question in the results after using the current search appliance. However, the current search appliance sometimes displays snippets of the reader responses attached to assigned submissions rather than the answer to the question, in error. Viewing these reader response snippets rather than the actual answer can be misleading and confusing for the reader. Ideally, as managers for the site, we would like to only have the text of the question's answer (and never the reader responses) in the snippets that populate in the search results for a reader using the site's search appliance.
  Accessibility considerations
  I need a way to efficiently navigate between snippets, they might appear as unordered list items, or might have headings denoting the beginning of each one.
