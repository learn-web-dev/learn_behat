# Site visitor adds their own response to questions
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-324
  Feature: As an anonymous site visitor
  I have access to the readers comments text area on published questions so that I can add my comments about a Q&A
  Accessibility considerations The process for me to read and add comments should be fully accessible.
  Edit fields should be clearly labeled, so that I know what I am editing.
  - Markup should be used to enable me to quickly move from one existing comment to another.
  - If there is a character limitation, I should be notified of this, either via the label of the affected edit field, via a dynamic change to page title, or via an ARIA-assertive alert. NOTE, assertive should be used, not rude as anything else would either cause me to miss the messaging or would take away my ability to conduct any edits.</li><ul>
