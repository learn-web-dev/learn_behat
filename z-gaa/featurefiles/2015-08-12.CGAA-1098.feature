# Redirect urls from previous versions of the site
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-1098
  As a repeat visitor (including search engine crawlers)
  I can use an outdated url (e.g. old bookmark or search result) to find the current equivalent page So that my outdated references bring me to a suitable destination.
