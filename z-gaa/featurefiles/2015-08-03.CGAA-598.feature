# Health information sheets
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-598
  Feature: consolidated writeups on a health topic. Scenario: site visitor reads As a site visitor
  I can find a consolidated writeup on a health topic and follow links to (local and online) resources So that I have a brief overview along with a list of where to get help or additional information.. Scenario: site visitor shares / prints As a site visitor needing to share information on a health topic
  I can print or email the health information sheet So that it is easy to use as a handout, saved file or email attachment.. Scenario (tentative*): licensee localizes resources As a Go Ask Alice! licensee
  I can change local resources mentioned in Health Information Sheets so that my key audience sees geographically relevant services *in workshop on Apr 23, someone mentioned resources would be removed from health information sheets or only used locally; if so, this scenario does not apply, and the Alice! team can choose whether they prefer to author PDFs and upload them vs. have the health information sheet content managed by the cms. --(KW) This user story is correct. We are planning to build the health information sheets so that licensees can add in their local resources.
  Scenario (tentative*): curate local and non-local resources As a member of the Alice! team
  I can mix on-campus, off-campus, online (website) resources and choose their order since breaking them into separate groups may not add value for the reader *this scenario may simply not be accurate, and mixing resources may have technical complexity; let's get a sense of the importance/accuracy of this scenario --(KW) this is a correct user story.
