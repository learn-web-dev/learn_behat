# Collections of curated information
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-291 |||||| Feature: reuse content As a content maintainer,
  I have a single place to edit any given piece of information So that I can be sure my updates replace all out-of-date information
  Feature: substitute references to local resources on licensee sites
  Feature: structured content
  (benefit is real; breaking it out is challenging...) As an information service provider,
  I can display information in different modes So that small amounts of information lead visitors to more complete information (e.g. a list of organization names that links to a description, contact information, related questions, etc.) ...
  Feature: As a publisher of content on the GAA site
  I can select multiple pieces of published content so that I can display this curated list of content as a collection and can determine the order of display within the collection.
  Scenario: As a content creator adding collections of published questions to the GAA site
  I am able to choose from a list of published questions so that I can select specific questions to be included in the collection and define the order of display for the questions. Examples are "Theme of the week", "New Q&As", "Go Ask Alice! Q&As" and "Especially about Columbians"
  Scenario: As a content creator adding collections of local resource links to the GAA site
  I am able to choose from a list of published resource links so that I can select specific local links to be included in the collection and define the order of display for the resources Examples are "In an emergency" These links will be switched out on licensee sites based on the mappings
  Scenario: As a content creator adding collections of global resource links to the GAA site
  I am able to choose from a list of published resource links flagged as global so that I can select specific global links to be included in the collection and define the order of display for the resources Examples are "Health Alerts" , "Product Recalls", "Food Recalls", "In the News"
