# Stage publish of the homepage
Feature: As a manager, I am able to stage the homepage publish by...
  1) staging the new and updated questions for the homepage publish. I first select which questions (new or updated) from the editor processed queue are ready for publish (i.e. have been researched, written/re-written, and edited). Once I make any additional edits, I set the status to "ready to publish", make a note in the comments of the submission and press "save". The question will then be found in the "scheduled publish date" queue.
  2) I also prepare the theme questions for the week. Once the theme questions are selected and any edits are made (if edits are made to theme questions, they are republished immediately, not set to "ready to publish"), I click on "create content" and
  select "theme" from the menu at the top right of the CMS screen. I create and enter a theme name, enter and select the theme questions (the process is similar to adding related Q&As in any submission) and save the theme.
  3) After new &amp; updated questions and theme questions are selected, I schedule the homepage publish. To schedule the homepage publish, I click on "schedule homepage publish" under the green "have Alice come to you!" tab on the dashboard screen.
  3a). I then select "create a new homepage publish". Then I select the date and time of the publish. Currently, I can only schedule the time of the publish at the top of the hour (ex. 11am or 2pm)
  3b). Then below, in the "homepage question repository," I select questions that have been imported from the "scheduled publish date" queue on the dashboard. I press "add" next to each question I would like to schedule for publish and it moves it to "homepage questions" box.
  3c). From the "theme repository" I select the theme I recently created by the name of the theme. I click "add" next to the theme I would like to schedule for the publish and it moves it to the "homepage theme".
  4) Once I am finished selecting the questions and theme, I press "create" at the bottom of the screen. This saves the homepage publish.
