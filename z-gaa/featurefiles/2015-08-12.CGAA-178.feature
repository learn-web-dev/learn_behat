  Scenario:

  I am shown my answer and the correct answer to each question on the quiz
  Accessibility considerations If correct and incorrect answers are presented in a summary, I need to be sure I know which correct answer goes with which question. A table or definition list could be used to convey this to me. If the original quiz is shown with answers marked, alt text can be used to denote "correct" or "incorrect" on graphics preceding my chosen answer and the correct answer. This would enable me to read through my quiz and, because of the alt attributes, know which answers were correct and which were not.
