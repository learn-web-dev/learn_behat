# Editor needs to upload supplemental documents
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-206
  As an editor, I may upload a supplemental document to the CMS if I am reviewing a newly written response (or an update to a published response) and see that it needs additional information or content added. The supplemental doc will reflect the resource(s) I referenced to inform the additional content to the question response I am editing.
