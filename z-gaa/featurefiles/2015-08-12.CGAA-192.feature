# Site visitor prints a hard copy of a Q&A
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-192 |||||| Feature: As an anonymous visitor to the site
  I print a question with the answer and responses so I can take it with me
  Scenario:
  As a health educator helping a student with a question,
  I can check the Go Ask Alice! site for the question and can print out a hardcopy of the question and answer for the student to take with them
  Accessibility considerations It is important to note here that the goal of this story is for the user to create a printout and that the created printout may not be accessible. If this process generates a PDF for printing, accessibility markup can be added to the generated PDF, however, this may not be required.
  As an assistive technology user, I need to: <ul><li>Have a clearly labeled control indicating that I will be printing something.</li><li>If this will result in a document opening in a PDF viewer, it would be nice to know this, however, not required.</li></ul>
