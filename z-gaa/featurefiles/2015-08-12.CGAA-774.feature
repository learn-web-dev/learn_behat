# Task assigner/expediter can determine path a question has taken
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-774
  As a task assigner/expeditor
  I can see what path a question has taken so that I can determine if the question needs additional time or if re-assignment to a different resource is appropriate
