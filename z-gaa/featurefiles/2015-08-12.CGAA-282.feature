# Site visitor accesses Health information sheets
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-282
  Feature: As an anonymous site visitor
  I would like to access health information sheets in order to get health information and resources both on-campus and off-campus that I can print
  Accessibility considerations:
  I need to be able to browse to and know which information sheet I'm choosing. PDFs should also be marked up in such a way that they are accessible.
