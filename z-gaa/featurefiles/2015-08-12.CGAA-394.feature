# Mass update of local links
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-394
  As a content editor of a licensee's site
  I can view a list of all Q&As where a particular related link is used and can replace the link on one or many pieces of content where the related link is associated (similar to the media browser)
