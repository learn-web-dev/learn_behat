# As a writer, I do not need to manipulate "Scheduled to be reviewed on" or "Scheduled to be pulblished on"
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-586
  The information might be helpful to me (to know that this is a question that I am updating by knowing the "Scheduled to be reviewed on" date) but I do not need to change or manipulate this date. It could confuse me to have it be an editable space.
