# Indicate that reader input has been addressed
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-430
  As the user responsible for making sure reader input, excluding reader responses, is addressed
  I can indicate that a reader input submission has been taken care of so that it no longer appears in my queue of submissions to be addressed
