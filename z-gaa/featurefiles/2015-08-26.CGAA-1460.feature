# handling dates when only the year is meaningful
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-1460
  As a researcher, sometimes the only "last reviewed" date I can find is a year, but no month or date. Its important for me to be able to put in what information I can though.. The system as it is does not accomodate a date that only has a year in it. It will not allow you to save the research if you do not have a date in the "expected format".
