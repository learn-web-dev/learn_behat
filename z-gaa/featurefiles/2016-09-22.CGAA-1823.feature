# queue administrators request manager input
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-1823
  As q.admin, I can comment on a newly submitted question before I make a decision. As long as I indicate I'm still working on this task, the question stays in my queue (regardless of other field values, even an admin decision). My comment and any further comments from the manager or from me appear in the comments section.
