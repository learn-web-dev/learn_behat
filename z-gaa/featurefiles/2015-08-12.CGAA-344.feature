# Read question, summaries of work before taking next steps
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-344 |||||| Feature: As an editorial team member
  I can review all existing summaries of work back-to-back before starting my effort So that the subtleties of my team mates' thinking can inform my own contribution to the effort
  Scenario:
  As a trainer of question admins
  I can help them understand they need to read a question before taking action on it. vs processing a question before I open it. however, spam that can be recognzied without opening it can still be handled
