# Edit live content across all sites, both central and licensees
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-1687
  As a live content editor, when I make a change to a published Question distributed to licensee sites, that change needs to be immediately/in short order* visible by all anonymous users to any of the sites (both the central and any and all of the licensees).. *A reasonably short amount of time, like one minute, may be acceptible â€“ but this needs to be confirmed with the client.
