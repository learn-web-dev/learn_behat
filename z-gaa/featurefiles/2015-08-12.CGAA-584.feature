  Sometimes, a writer identifies a gap within the research and is able to locate reserach to inform their written response. In that case, we as the writer to submit a supplemental reserach document. In the demo version, I'm unsure where they would add research. It would be good to differentiate where they can find the compiled research and where they can add in supplemental research if necessary.
