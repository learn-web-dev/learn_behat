# Researcher needs to work through revisions
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-261
  As a researcher
  I want to understand how research has evolved in answering a given question
  I can look at a research node and attribute changes to the different authors
  I can comment when I make a change
  Track who and why someone made a revision
