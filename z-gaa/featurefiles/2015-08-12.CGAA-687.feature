  As a researcher looking at related questions that inform the research effort,
  I can add comments about the relationship so we have a synopsis of how it relates to the current research effort (in current template) so we don't overlap work and focus research effort on things we've not already written so we help get writers up to speed on this topic so we answer the gap rather than recreate so we reference in the text of our response so we better decide whether to answer the question at this stage
