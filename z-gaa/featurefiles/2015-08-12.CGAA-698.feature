# profile of a fresh docroot
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-698
  as a developer each time I fire up a new docroot, I get a common starting point with a choice of key extras <ul><li>minimal or a copy of cleanroom</li><li>no content or prepopulated with sample content</li><li>bartik and seven or zen so that the docroot is either a very simple build or a more complete reflection of the state of development</li><ul>
