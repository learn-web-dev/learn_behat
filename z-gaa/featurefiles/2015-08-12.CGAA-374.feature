# Site visitor views scrolling list of raves
  https://ownsourcing.atlassian.net/browse/CGAA-374 |||||| Feature: As a site visitor
  I am presented with a rotating banner of raves about the Go Ask Alice! site to let me know what other visitors think about the site
  Scenario:
  As a site visitor I am presented with a rotating banner containing text from site raves
  Accessibility considerations
  I should have a way to stop this banner as changing content may disrupt my focus, the keyboard focus, or screen reader focus. I should be able to read each rave, however, ARIA should not be used to communicate this messaging to me as it may make it
