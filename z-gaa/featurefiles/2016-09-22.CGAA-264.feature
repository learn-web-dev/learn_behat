  Accessibility considerations
  I need to be able to choose the type of input I'm providing. If radio buttons are used, these should be given clear labels, a field set and a legend. If other controls are used, I must be able to understand and identify the correct control, must be able to interact with it and must be able to determine its state if appropriate.
  Feature: As a reader input admin
  I can choose which type of input I am giving so that I don't have to navigate to different areas to give different types of input and so I can interact with the editorial team in a way I want
  Scenario: recategorize As an Alice! team member
  I can recategorize reader input so that it appears in the correct workflow queue to ensure Alice! followthrough
