  As an anonymous visitor When I select a menu for a section of the site
  I can see all secondary menu items in that section So that I can make a further selection before leaving my current page. When I am in a section of the site
  I can see a persistently open menu for that section So that without needing to interact with a menu I can see at a glance what other options exist in the current section. When I am in a section of the site
  I can select a menu for another section So that I can see secondary menu items in different sections and make a choice before leaving my current page
