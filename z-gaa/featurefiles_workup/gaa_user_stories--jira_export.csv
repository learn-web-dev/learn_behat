Thanks for writing up the story!

Regarding working off-site rather than in the CMS, we hope you can gather feedback from your team about writers placing their work in the CMS vs uploading documents. As discussed in the last Workshop, uploaded documents would not take advantage of the change tracking, revisions and workflow we've discussed.

By way of update on the discussion of working in some sort of 'desktop client' vs working directly in the browser, we've done additional research and believe the best scenario will be working directly in the browser. We all agreed that copy-paste into the CMS is pretty undesireable; the alternative of working in another application is likely to make ongoing maintenance and support unduely complicated.

The alternative we raised on the call was to improve the tools for working in the browser, e.g. implementing an AutoSave feature and providing warnings of unsaved content when people try to navigate away from a page or close it before hitting save (Jira has similar tools, if you want to give that a try). Our goal would be to minimize the tradeoffs of working in the browser, so please let us know of others you have come across.","22/May/14 10:49 AM;amanda;Yes, improving the tools for working in the browser would make that option much more desirable. Are you requesting we gather feedback about the two options now? ",,

1) staging the new and updated questions for the homepage publish. I first select which questions (new or updated) from the editor processed queue are ready for publish (i.e. have been researched, written/re-written, and edited). Once I make any additional edits, I set the status to ""ready to publish"", make a note in the comments of the submission and press ""save"". The question will then be found in the ""scheduled publish date"" queue.
2) I also prepare the theme questions for the week. Once the theme questions are selected and any edits are made (if edits are made to theme questions, they are republished immediately, not set to ""ready to publish""), I click on ""create content"" and select ""theme"" from the menu at the top right of the CMS screen. I create and enter a theme name, enter and select the theme questions (the process is similar to adding related Q&As in any submission) and save the theme.
3) After new & updated questions and theme questions are selected, I schedule the homepage publish. To schedule the homepage publish, I click on ""schedule homepage publish"" under the green ""have Alice come to you!"" tab on the dashboard screen. 
3a). I then select ""create a new homepage publish"". Then I select the date and time of the publish. Currently, I can only schedule the time of the publish at the top of the hour (ex. 11am or 2pm)
3b). Then below, in the ""homepage question repository,"" I select questions that have been imported from the ""scheduled publish date"" queue on the dashboard. I press ""add"" next to each question I would like to schedule for publish and it moves it to ""homepage questions"" box.
3c). From the ""theme repository"" I select the theme I recently created by the name of the theme. I click ""add"" next to the theme I would like to schedule for the publish and it moves it to the ""homepage theme"".
4) Once I am finished selecting the questions and theme, I press ""create"" at the bottom of the screen. This saves the homepage publish.

feature: display timestamps on question

feature: Manager makes change without changing last reviewed on date
As a manager, it is important to be able to save changes to a submission (Q&A) without changing the last reviewed date.  This helps managers to make immediate & necessary changes (no major content changes) while still keeping the last reviewed date that flags it for review for larger content changes within the three year review process. Currently, we are able to do this by setting the status of a submission to ""action required"" when we are done making edits in the WYSIWYG and then pressing save. Once saved, we re-enter the submission and change the status once again to ""live"" and then press save. The CMS then requires you to answer the question ""Are you sure you want this to go live?"" and you must select yes. Then, presumably, the changes should be saved to the live site, without changing the last reviewed date. However, in this process, the CMS unpredictably updates the last reviewed date to the current date OR reverts back to a previous last reviewed date. this is a bug in the current system. There also seems to be an option on the current CMS that would allow us to manually change the last reviewed date, but we have not yet figured out how to do this. It would be nice if this function actually worked so that in the event the last reviewed date did change in this process, we could manually change it.

Do you think it would be reasonable to put Jan 1 of the given year? If not, we can look into the development effort required to change the behavior of the software (requires custom code that is probably easy enough to write but adds complexity and labor to future upgrades and security fixes).

Interested to get your feedback.","26/Aug/15 11:22 AM;kathlynw;Is it necessary to have a calendar pop up? Even the calendar, as it is, is a bit restrictive. I see that the drop down year selection only goes to 2012. There are times (though rare) that a piece of research is older than 2012 (example: a researcher added in an article from 1848 for context). That means you still have to manually type in the date anyway. As such, it could be good to just have the ability to put in a date manually, rather than be prompted with a calendar if it won't allow just the year to be entered or go back in time far enough.",26/Aug/15 11:26 AM;kay v;sure - we can look into changes to configuration that improve the usability hurdles you're describing - thanks for the additional details [~kathlynw]!,

When this happens, the cause is typically due to using Internet Explorer (which the current CMS is not optimized for, so errors are common, and thus, anyone accessing the CMS is strongly advised to only use Firefox). However, we've also had two different assigned submissions get mixed up — meaning at some point (we don't know how), word documents and other information attached to one assigned submission then get added to another entirely different submission. Most recently, this happened while using Firefox, so we have no idea how it happened. The problem was caught by the manager, as both assigned submissions were in the ""editor — processed"" queue. The submissions in questions are ""Mucus in stool harmful?"" (NID: 367972) and ""Goji berries — Superfood? Scam? Safe?"" (NID: 368392). Currently, the ""Mucus in stool harmful?"" question has all of the research, writer, and editor documents for ""Goji berries — Superfood, scam, safe?"" question. It even has the same title (Goji berries) when you search for it in the CMS. However, you can tell there's an error because the comments are not the same and when you click on the live question ID link, it takes you to the ""Mucus in stool harmful?"" live published question. The actual ""Goji berries"" question remains in tact with no error. The other clue that something was awry was the submission histories for both questions (see attached). On the same day, near the same time, it has me, the manager, reassigning and uploading all the Goji berry documents to the Mucus in Stool question (which I did not do). The purpose of mentioning this is that this is not an isolated bug, we've seen it happen at least 5 to 10 times. We are concerned that the migration of all the data we have may also see this bug occur again.

As a reader, I am able to see snippets of the answer of a question in the results after using the current search appliance. However, the current search appliance sometimes displays snippets of the reader responses attached to assigned submissions rather than the answer to the question, in error. Viewing these reader response snippets rather than the actual answer can be misleading and confusing for the reader.

For example, a blind person – or even a person with low vision – will not be able to see the distorted characters.  Some CAPTCHA solutions offer an audio alternative, however this alternative is often severely garbled to the point where it’s almost impossible to understand.  If a CAPTCHA must be used, then at a minimum, alt text is required to indicate the purpose of the graphical characters.  In addition, there should be an alternative method for solving the CAPTCHA such as a link that triggers an audio-based CAPTCHA.  That said, there are a few solutions that employ a logic puzzle as the CAPTCHA.  For example, “How many letters are in the word “wastebaskets”” “What letter comes after G?””  Some implementations of this can be found at http://textcaptcha.com/

Ideally, non-CAPTCHA methods can be used to help limit spam, many plugins exist to help with this process.  Where this is not possible, however, logic puzzles present a relatively safe and accessible alternative.  At the very least, a CAPTCHA solution should have alt text explaining the purpose of the graphical characters and should have a link to allow for an alternative method such as audio.

Please let me know if I can help further, or if there are additional questions.

Hi Alex,
 
Since your submission for ""St. John's wort"" was published today, I wanted to share some feedback with you about it. I think your submission was an improvement upon the previously published response, but a few edits were made prior to publish to clarify information. Here's a few specific points of feedback regarding those changes:

·         In the final paragraph, you mention information regarding proper dosages per the reader’s question. As you know, it’s best to answer the reader’s question(s), at least briefly, in the first paragraph. Thus, this information was moved to the first paragraph. Additionally, the sentence was a bit unclear: “Although the dosage of St. John's Wort that has been used in most studies is a 900 milligram daily dose taken in 300 mg increments three times a day, that does not mean that this dosage is appropriate in all situations.”. Once this information was moved up, we changed it to read “You also asked about the recommended dosage for this supplement. How much of the supplement to take and the number of times you'll need to take it daily will vary depending upon the condition you wish to treat.” There’s a bit of variance it seems when it comes to dosages, so just linking to another source seemed to be most appropriate.

·         In the second paragraph, you mention that taking St. John’s wort is not recommended if you’re already taking prescription anti-depressants. However, you also mention this in the second bullet point list. The mention in the second paragraph was removed prior to publish.

·         In the first bullet point of the second list of bullets regarding the use of St. John’s wort with other medications, you mention that “Even in cases where the combination isn’t dangerous, St. John’s wort can affect how the body metabolizes …” was simplified by saying “Additionally, St. John’s wort can affect how the body metabolizes…”

Stylistic details to consider include:

·         Try to vary your references to St. John’s wort throughout the response.

·         If your bullet points (like the ones in the second set of bullet points) end a sentence, add a period instead of a colon.

 
Despite these changes, I think  you had a lot of strong content here. Also, I liked the way you began the response and I’m a big a fan of puns…so the last sentence in the final paragraph was also great. :) If you have any questions, please let me know. See attached for full edit.

Thanks,
Katie

I do this my opening clicking on ""schedule homepage publish"" and selecting the option to ""update an existing homepage publish date"". Then from the drop down menu, i select the date and time of the homepage publish I'd like to review. 
Then, I click on the new and updated questions I'd like to review, which opens up each submission individually. If I catch any errors, I send the suggested edits in an email to the manager prior to the publish date/time. 
After I review the new and updated questions, I review the theme questions. Selecting the preview of the them allows me to click on each individual question scheduled for the them and see it on the live site (since they are just a collection of already published questions).

Story: Researcher is preparing a researcher document to be submitted. Part of this process requires the researcher to identify related questions that are live on the site. These related questions will be used in the researcher document to provide context for the writer and may, ultimately, be used in the published answer to provide suggested reading for GAA! users. As the researcher looks for related questions on the live site, s/he finds a Q&A that is in need of major updates. Currently, the researcher will email the manager notifying her that the Q&A needs work.

Problem: A bit inefficient. Researcher needs to use a different system to notify manager of the Q&A that needs updated. Manager also has to use a different system to reference which question has been flagged.

- First view lists the latest (three) items with their full view mode (to be used at the top of the section page, see below), and it is called something like ""Latest (three) Polls"", and it does not have a title.
- Second view displays the stuff to be displayed on the front page (as a block, may be unneeded), the section page and the ""all but the current"" block, and it is called something like ""Polls"".
-- First display is a page and it is called simply ""Page"":
--- lists all but the latest (three) items with its (their) teaser view mode,
--- has the title ""Polls"",
--- the header contains the first view.
-- Second display is a block (for the front page, if needed) and it is called simply ""Block"":
--- lists the latest (three) items with its (their) full view mode,
--- does not have a title,
--- the header is a link to /section with the text ""Weekly Poll"",
--- the footer is also a link to /section with the text ""More polls"".
-- Third display is a block (for the node pages) and it is called ""Block (excluder)"":
--- lists the all the items with their teaser view mode, but the current one (as a contextual filter, and a second tricky PHP contextual filter in case of collections that filters for the same type that the current collection node has),
--- does not have headers nor footers,
--- the title of the display is ""More polls"".
- Block setup is as follows.
-- The ""View: Polls: Block (excluder)"" block is at the bottom of the ""Content"" region, only for the ""Poll"" content type.
-- The ""View: Polls"" block is in the ""Second sidebar"" region, only for the front page.

This is the generic overview of the funnels. Pretty much every funnels have some exceptions.

- Quizzes: as the reveal module can only handle one quiz on a page (ATM), only the latest quiz is displayed with its full view mode at /quizzes.
- ""Themes of the Week"" is only one type of a Collection node, and block visibility is tied to CTs – so the same block should handle all the different types of the same type.
-- Contextually filtering by the current node's ID *and* a field of it is not supported by Views, so this second contextual filter is done as PHP code that loads the node from the first contextual filter and applies the type_of_collection from that.
-- This allows having one single display for all types of a collection, but limits to have the same label for that list for every types of a collection.
-- Eventually this block could be replaced some easy-to-understand custom code that allows greater flexibility.
- As ""Themes of the Week"", ""New Q&As"" and ""Fact sheets"" should all have a section page, the same view should have a different page display for each of them, with different titles, headers and no result behaviors.
- As ""Themes of the Week"" and ""New Q&As"" should both have a block on the front page, the same view should have a different block display for both of them, with different headers, footers, no result behaviors and fields displayed in a semantically better way.
- As ""Fact sheets"" are to be ordered by their title, it does not make sense to have the first with its full view mode and the others with their teaser view mode, so there is no block display in the first view for ""Fact sheets"", and the page display for ""Fact sheets"" in the second view lists all the collections with this type with their teaser view mode.
- EVA cannot be used:
-- the full view mode would contain an EVA that lists all the ""other"" stuff of the same kind,
-- if there is even one case which displays one node with its full view mode and some other nodes below it with their teaser view mode, we cannot avoid having the same ""other"" node listed at both places.","16/Jun/15 2:00 PM;leslieg;If I understand the developer documentation, the first and third blocks display teaser items for the remaining polls, quizzes and themes.  My recollection is that we were going to display some of the remaining items (5 perhaps) and then have a ""read more"" link with pagination for the user to get to the rest of them.  There could be hundreds of old polls for example and we wouldn't want to list 100 teasers in the block.  I believe the more links were in http://gaacrrc19jsqeqv2dj.devcloud.acquia-sites.com for the demo on 6/12 for at least some of the funneling types.",18/Jun/15 4:03 AM;laci;None of those pages should have 100s of content items on them as all of them should have pagination enabled.,02/Jul/15 5:42 PM;leslieg;working as expected
